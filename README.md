# Pza Emulator for hanmatek/hm310t power supply

The **main goals** of this emulator are:

- to provide the exact same USB interface that the **hanmatek/hm310t** power supply.
- to run on a RaspberryPi Pico H to be cheap and easily integrated on a test bench.

`Why not virtual USB interfaces ?`

To have a solution independent from OS and their implementation specificities
